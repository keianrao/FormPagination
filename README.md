# FormPagination

A test app for Cordova. A usual simple browser app, presently using the Web Storage API to persist data across pages, for just a bit of user interaction.

!["Added version 1.0.0 for project Aliquot.", log message above two titled boxes "FormPagination" and "Aliquot", each having versions within like "0.2.0", "0.1.0" each on a line. The versions are sorted. And then a 'Add a project version' link on the bottom.](Screenshot.jpeg)
