# FormPagination

A test app for Cordova. A usual simple browser app, presently using the Web Storage API to persist data across pages, for just a bit of user interaction.

![From top to bottom: "That version for that project is already recorded." red error message, above two titled boxes "FormPagination" and "Aliquot", each having versions within like "0.2.0", "0.1.0" on each line. And then a 'Add a project version' link on the bottom.](Screenshot.jpeg)
